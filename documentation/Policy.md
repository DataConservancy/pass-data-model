# Policy

A policy determines what rules should be followed by a [Submission](Submission.md).

| Field  		| Type  		| Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| __id*__ | String | Unique Policy URI |
| type* | String: _university_, _funder_ | Type of policy - whether implemented by funder, or the institution hosting PASS _Note: this is still a bit squishy, but could be used for logic to create a default repo_|
| title* | String | Title of policy e.g. "NIH Public Access Policy" |
| description | String | Several sentence description of policy |
| repositories* | List[[Repository](Repository.md)] | List of repositories that can satisfying this policy |
| __creationDate*__ | DateTime | Date the record was created |
| __updatedDate*__ | DateTime | Date the record was last updated |

*required  
_autogenerated fields are in **bold** and are readonly_

_Note: this is basic at the moment. Eventually additional fields to help with application of policy logic could be added e.g. materialType to support data policies, some sense of whether the policy is required or can be overridden by complying with another policy etc._
