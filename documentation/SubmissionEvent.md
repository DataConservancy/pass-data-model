# SubmissionEvent
The SubmissionEvent model captures significant events that are performed by an agent and occur against a [Submission](Submission.md). In the current implementation, the agent will be a PASS [User](User.md). The definition of "significant" will evolve depending on which events are useful to capture in order to e.g. trigger notifications, or form an audit trail. The events that are currently deemed significant for capture are documented under [`eventType`](#event-type-options).
